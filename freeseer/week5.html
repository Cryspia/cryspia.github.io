					<h2><span id="h2n1">Works done in this week</span></h2>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Modify the PRs</span></span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>Change the code for PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/609">#609</a> and 
					PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/615">#615</a> according to the comments. Now the next step of #609 still 
					needs discussion, but the main function of both are already finished.</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2"></span>Find a new bug about unchecking the input source</h3>
					<p>The issue is already created as issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/628">#628</a> it happens when record the 
					videos without an audio input.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n3">Continue research on the Low FPS Problem</span></h3>
					<p>I found that when output resolution is too high, the output file cannot be played regardless of the input size. I am still not sure 
					whether it can be a bug or a gstreamer plugin problem (if latter, it may be hard to solve). I will look into that problem if I have time next 
					week. The case is commented in PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/615">#615</a></p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n4">Modify the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8EuCGMW1dvM0q_AP_0c3fAGHWS0iGW5EcS67HIbr_I/edit?usp=sharing">Project Proposal</a></span></h3>
					<p>Change the weekly plan in the proposal according the comment by the mentors. Since the work amount seems not enough, more suggestions 
					on work that I can do are needed. I left the weeks TBD in the proposal.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n5">Look for documents for Windows Desktop Audio Capture plugin</span></h3>
					<p>Since there is no plugin that can help capture audio in Windows, I am planing to make a new one. Thanks for <B>zxiiro</B> for help me 
					find the documents so that it is much easier to start. I will start working on it next week.</p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>In next week, I will try to finish the code review for the existing 2 PRs. Besides, I will create a new PR for the Windows Desktop 
					Audio Capture plugin and upload a test version of it (Maybe a review version according to the difficulty of this job). Also, I will continue 					
					modify the proposal for the work to do. If I still have time, I will look into the bugs that I have created to see if I can solve some 
					of them.</p>
