					<h2><span id="h2n1">Works done in this week</span></h2>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Fix the PRs</span></span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>Fix problems in PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/609">#609</a> and 
					PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/615">#615</a> For <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/609">#609</a>, 
					it is a bit more complicated. Because I tried to use rebase -i to squash all the commits. And there are conflicts with 
					the master branch for new functions. Since I was not familiar with rebase -i command, it took me some time to solve the 
					situation.</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2"></span>Try adding Windows Desktop Audio Capture.</h3>
					<p>There seems to be no more plugins that could be suitable for Windows audio capture, so I start look into the plugins that 
					I have already found carefully. "directsoundsrc" is unhelpful because it cannot select a source device. dshowvideosrc can be 
					used but I met a bug that I cannot solve anyway. I have posted that bug as reply in 
					issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/633">#633</a></p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n3">Small bugs fixing</span></h3>
					<p>Tried to fix two small bugs that I have found and created PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/637">#637</a> and 
					PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/639">#639</a> for them. They are ready for merge. 
					<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/639">#639</a> is not really a hard one, but I took more than one hour to find 
					it. I need more practice.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n4">Start working on DPI adapting UI</span></h3>
					<p>Presently, the UI, especially the configtool part works terribly on high DPI screens (such as my computer, so I need to 
					change the DPI to 96 when work on the project. It is horrible). So I start working on that. Since it is my first time using 
					Qt, it took me some time to look for documents and suitable API. Luckily, it is not too long. I now created a test version and 
					make a PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/640">#640</a> for that.</p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>I would firstly start working on the Windows Desktop Audio Capture or close. Then I would continue the DPI adapting function. 
					Finally, since I am almost out of work, I will try to discuss with mentors on IRC to make sure what to do next.</p>
