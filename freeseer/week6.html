					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Modify the PRs</span></span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>Change the code for PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/609">#609</a> and 
					PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/615">#615</a> according to the code review. If there are no more reviews, 
					both of the PRs are ready for merge.</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2"></span>Try to add a new plugin for Windows Desktop Audio Capture.</h3>
					<p>Windows cannot capture desktop audio like Linux using pulsesrc plugin, so I did some researches and tried to solve this problem. 
					However, it is seems to be a tough task. I have go through the SDK document and APIs on the official website, and find few plugins are 
					useful for this task. I have tried several including openalsrc and osssrc, but they are all Linux only. I found a usable one 
					called directsoundsrc, but it cannot make any configurations so there is no difference with autoaudiosrc. There is another one called 
					dshowaudiosrc. But it seems that there are still bugs for that in gstreamer0.10.7 so it is still unhelpful. The full discussion can be 
					found at issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/633">#633</a></p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n3">Continue research on the Low FPS Problem</span></h3>
					<p>From the idea of the new plugin for Windows audio capture, I tried to solve the frame rate problem via similar ways. I tried to find 
					some more efficient plugins. However, there are too few plugins for Windows and some of them are out of date or lack of 
					document. I found a plugin called ksvideosrc which is mentioned by many people, but it seems just a camera capture plugin to replace 
					dshowvideosrc. Since dshowvideosrc does not appear to have problems, there is no need to replace it. So this research does not have much 
					progress this week.</p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>If some suggestions or plugins can be given about either Windows Desktop Audio Capture or the Desktop Frame Rate improvement, I 
					will continue working on them. If not, I will try to work on some bugs that I have created. Maybe start at issue 
					<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/617">#617</a>.</p>
