					<h2><span id="h2n1">Works done in this week</span></h2>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Finished the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8EuCGMW1dvM0q_AP_0c3fAGHWS0iGW5EcS67HIbr_I/edit?usp=sharing">Project Proposal</a></span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>According to the plan that I have made, I finished my project proposal. Since I am not very sure about the work load 
					of the work as well as the difficulty, there could be variable changes done to that document later. I have made a basic schedule in that, and 
					that can be changed according to my work process.</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2">Find bug (<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/581">#581</a>) and pulled a fix</span></h3>
					<p>It is a bug caused by typo in record.py, which used an non-existed variable 'starTime' (should be 'startTime'). 
					The Report window under the Help menu cannot be opened because of that. A <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/582">fix pull</a> 
					has already been created. In this period, I also learnt the standard to create the branch and write the commit log in open source project.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n3">Find bug (<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/584">#584</a>) and pulled a fix</span></h3>
					<p>It is a bug that happened specifically on unicode languages (Japanese/日本語, Simplified Chinese/简体中文, and Traditional Chinese/繁體中文).
					It is because that some ".format" methods in record.py has the ascii body but unicode input. This bug can be easily fixed by change the body 
					also to unicode so that there will be no confliction. A <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/585">fix pull</a> has already 
					been created.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n4">Created a new issue (<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/583">#583</a>) about the translation rate</span></h3>
					<p>The translation is out of date since there are quite a lot new functions with new text. So the translation also needs update. 
					Besides, some of the text is not yet added to the translation framework. This can also be considered as a bug.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n5">Finished the translation for Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese</span></h3>
					<p>As described in the title. The translation rates for Chinese have been made 152/152. There are still some text in English after that, but 
					that can be considered as framework problem. A <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/587">pull request</a> has been created.</p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>According to schedule, I will look into the code to prepare for the auto-localization-changing according the system environment, there will 
					be no pull request (though maybe some period work upload to new branch on github according to the work speed). Hopefully, all this work can be 
					finished by week 4.</p>
					<p>Beyond the schedule, I may keep looking for bugs and would try to solve them.</p>
