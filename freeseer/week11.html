					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Continue the work for DPI Adapting UI</span></span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>The mixin problem for PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/640">#640</a> 
					has finally been solved. It was my very stupid mistake. Thanks for all the mentors help.
					Maybe more times are needed. Beside that, The unit test for the DPI Adapting code has been finished. Although the 
					code for the test is not complicated, I spent much time on learning about the setup/teardown orders and the module 
					monkeypatch.</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2"></span>Skip the RTMP test for Windows</h3>
					<p>There are many test cases fail under Windows, one for them is because that Windows does not support RTMP plugin. 
					I made some modify to the unit test and make a skip for Windows. The details can be seen in PR 
					<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/662">#662</a>.</p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>In next week, I will try to set the column width for talkeditor to make it seems better under high DPI situations. 
					And I will finish the DPI Adapting UI PR.</p>
