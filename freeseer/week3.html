					<h2><span id="h2n1">Works done in this week</span></h2>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Read code and adding the auto language changing</span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>According to the issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/476">#476</a>, we need the UI language 
					to be auto changing according to the user's system environment. I have finished reading the code and understand it. I can start adding this 
					function at any time. But it seems that it auto language changing would have some conflicts with the default language in the user settings. 
					So I have created a new issue for that (<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/601">#601</a>).</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2">Fixed the problems in the PR last week</span></h3>
					<p>Add some comments for PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/585">#585</a> to explain the reason to fix this bug.<br/>
					Since the framework has been updated, I also update the PR <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/587">#587</a>.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n3">Find two bugs for the new ConfigTool framework.</span></h3>
					<p>It seems that there are some problems with the new framework. I have reopened issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/576">
					#576</a> which is the font problem under Windows. This is seems to happen again in the new framework. I also opened a new issue 
					<a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/602">#602</a>. It is a window size problem.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n4">A suggestion about the language menu and the default language setting</span></h3>
					<p>The suggestion is created as issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/600">#600</a>. I create this because I think 
					the language menu and the language config are duplicated.</p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>If the auto language changing is still needed, I will add that function and create a pull request next week. If it is decided that it is 
					not needed any more, I will start the plug-in things early. Also, I will keep looking for some bugs and try to fix some small ones.</p>
