					<h2><span id="h2n1">Works done in this week</span></h2>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n1">Finished the Auto Language Function</span></h3>
					<div class="firstpara"><p>The Auto language Function, which is mentioned in issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/476">
					#476</a> has been finished. A pull request <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/609">#609</a> has been created. The designing 
					details is discussed in issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/601">#601</a>. There could be some further requirement 
					in pull request.</p></div>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n2">Finished a Test Version of Resolution Changing Function</span></h3>
					<p>The is an API in the video mixer plug-in but not really in function. I am planing to make it functional according to my project proposal. 
					I created an issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/614">#614</a> related to this and have pushed a test version of the 
					resolution changing feature <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/pull/615">#615</a>. The feature is not totally finished yet. Hopefully, 
					I will finish the feature as well as the pull request next week.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n3">Research on the Low FPS Problem</span></h3>
					<p>The desktop capture keeps getting low FPS when output. Since I can resize the output video via the new function, I did a simple research 
					on the reason of getting that low FPS. The goal is to make sure whether that problem can be improved in my ability. The result is posted as 
					issue <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/616">#616</a>.</p>
					<h3><span id="h2n1h3n4">Find a Bug about Record Region on Windows</span></h3>
					<p>On Windows, the user can choose a region as the desktop capture source, but that region is not really captured (still full screen capture). 
					The bug is posted <a href="https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/617">#617</a></p>
					<h2><span id="h2n2">Works plan to do</span></h2>
					<p>In next week, I will modify my project proposal according to Machael's suggestions and my research result. For the work things, I will first 
					try to finish the resolution function (If there are some additional requirements on that function, I may spend half more week.) If I still have 
					time after that, I will do a further research on the low fps problem and see if I can solve it.</p>
